# P1 Emoji Fish

## Overview
This is a spin-off of the simple game Go Fish, except with emojis. I picked this because playing Go Fish with my mother and siblings is something I vividly remember and thought it would be nice to make something similar that other people can play.

## Game Rules
User always plays first and clicks on start to start the game
User clicks on an emoji they'd like to match to request it from the computer
If computer has the particular emoji, they give it/them to user and user gets to request again
If computer does not have it, user must 'go fish' and click on the fishbowl to be dealt an emoji
If the emoji dealt from the fishbow matches the one user requested, user gets to request again
If the fishbowl deals a different emoji, user's turn is over and computer requests an emoji
The game is won by whoever has matched and run out of emojis by the time the fishbowl is empty


## User Stories
